# C# Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of lectures, examples, and projects for the purpose of learning the C# programming language. We use the latest stable version of C# for these tutorials which is, as of writing, version 8.0.

## Prerequisites

In order to program using C#, you need an installation of the .NET Core Framework. You can install the framework using the instructions provided [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Make sure to install the SDK, not just the runtime). Make sure that the version of .NET Core installed is 3.0+ for the code to work.
