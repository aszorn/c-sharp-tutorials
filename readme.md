# C# Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of lectures, examples, and projects for the purpose of learning the C# programming language. We use the latest stable version of C# for these tutorials which is, as of writing, version 8.0.

## Prerequisites

In order to program using C#, you need an installation of the .NET Core Framework. You can install the framework using the instructions provided [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Make sure to install the SDK, not just the runtime). Make sure that the version of .NET Core installed is 3.0+ for the code to work.

## How to Use

You should create a [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of this repository so that you may work on the exercises and projects in your own version controlled environment.

There are a set of general topics that we cover in these tutorials. They are broadly separated into sections. In each section, there are an ordered series of lectures that you should read and complete the exercises in. *Some exercises introduce content that will be used in later lectures*. At the end of each section are a few optional lectures that are not necessary to read through to complete later exercises and projects but may be useful for understanding some concepts in practice. After reading all of the required lectures for a section, complete the associated projects for that section. The lectures and projects are listed below.
